Title: ACEOnline 4.2 Guide (VS2013)

I've talked with @Future about it a long time ago, but because he's got no time/or is just lazy. I'm doing it right now.

Let's get started:

[B]Source Compilation[/B]

First of all you need to download the Source (https://mega.nz/#!Q8gmwAiL!lqq3DWTX5aYbvOCvPNIN8L7vWFrRm9-eSkEsvtGiXNY), it's reworked to be compiled under Visual Studio 2013 (MFC Libraries are needed). Visual Studio 2015 should compile fine aswell, didn't tested it.
Then you should have a rar file like this:

(It's packet with the RAR5 method, so please be sure to use WinRar 5 or simmilar programs)

Next you need to extract the source to your harddrive, doesn't matter where it is.
I extracted it to: C:\EP_42_Source\. 
It should look like this:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/3.PNG[/IMG]

Next go to \GameServer\ and open GameServer.sln with Visual Studio 2013

Now click on the Dropbox under the menu entries to select a build configuration, i recommend Wikigames_R for a simple English Server setup.
You are free to test/use other configs, depending on the language you are using (all localization files should be included).

Now click on your solution and select "Build Solution"
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/7.PNG[/IMG]

Build should take around 5-10 minutes because Multicore Compile is disabled.
When the compile is finished, the buildlog should look like this:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/8.PNG[/IMG]
[COLOR="#FF0000"]!!! ATTENTION !!![/COLOR]
When using other configs then Wikigames_R, you have to set the include paths etc on your own because i just edited the english release config.

Now let's look where our files are (yes, masang splitted them somehow instead of putting all in one final folder)

DB Editor:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/9.PNG[/IMG]

Launcher.atm
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/10.PNG[/IMG]

Pre Launcher:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/11.PNG[/IMG]

Admin Tool, Monitor Tool, Questloader:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/12.PNG[/IMG]

Server Binaries:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/13.PNG[/IMG]


[B]Server Setup[/B]
To change the IP, open LocalizationDefineCommon.h and find following lines:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/14.PNG[/IMG]

Change the define CHOICE_PRE_SERVER_IP_OR_DOMAIN_IN_XOR to your encrypted IP Adress, you can find the XOR codes in AtumParam.h
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/15.PNG[/IMG]

You will need the STR_XOR_KEY_STRING_PRE_SERVER_ADDRESS Key to encrypt your IP for Launcher and PreLauncher.

To change your AdminTool and MonitorTool logins, go to AtumParamProtocolFunctions.cpp and find following lines:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/16.PNG[/IMG]

The structure of the array is displayed in this picture.
Here you will need the STR_XOR_KEY_STRING_SERVER_INFO key to encrypt your Logins/IPs.

Recompile your Tools to apply the changes.

[B]Now to the Server:[/B]
Create somewhere on your harddrive a serverfolder and create in it folders like this:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/17.PNG[/IMG]

Go into the log folder and create 3 folders like this:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/18.PNG[/IMG]

Now go back into the main folder and into the bin folder, and copy your server bins into it.
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/19.PNG[/IMG]

Go back into the main folder and then into the config folder and copy the content of the \GameServer\config\ config folder in the servers config folder.

[B]Database Setup:[/b]
Install a MSSQL Version you want, i'm using MSSQL 2014 Express. Don't forget to check Mixed Mode when asked during the install process. You need to set a password for the user SA, save it somewhere.
Connect to your database with the SA login data.
Go to Database, right click it and select Restore Database...
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/21.PNG[/IMG]

Now select device and click on the button with the three dots
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/22.PNG[/IMG]

Now click on Add
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/23.PNG[/IMG]

Now navigate to your database backups (they should be in the main directory of your source)
[/IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/24.PNG[/IMG]

Then click 2 times OK, until you are here:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/25.PNG[/IMG]

Now select the only existing backup and write your destination database(when not given) into the text field Database.
Click on OK to restore the Database.

Do the same process with atum2_db_account too.

Now your database should look like this:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/26.PNG[/IMG]

[B]Config Setup:[/B]
Get your IP and save it somewhere (either open cmd and type ipconfig or when using hamachi, start it and copy it from there)
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/27.PNG[/IMG]

Now open global.cfg in your config folder and edit folling lines:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/28.PNG[/IMG

$LOCAL_IP_ADDR is your IP adress (From Hamachi or IPConfig).
$SERVER_GROUP_NAME is the name of your server.
$LANGUAGE_TYPE is the language your server is using.

Now scroll down and comment folling lines with a #
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/29.PNG[/IMG]
just let the first line uncommented. Write there yozr Server Group Name.

Scroll further and comment a few lines too like on the screenshot:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/30.PNG[/IMG]
not type into the first line of this block your Server Group Name again and your IP.

Now scroll down until you see:
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/31.PNG[/IMG]
Change it on your own will. 

The next couple of lines are the allowed IP's to use the Admin tool, write there your IP and all allowed ones.
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/32.PNG[/IMG]

Now scroll down to the Update Settings:
Change them to your HTTP/FTP Settings (I won't give a AutoUpdate Guide, just search for it)
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/33.PNG[/IMG]

Now scroll down to find (finally) the DB Data
[IMG]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/St0rmy95/AceTutorial/master/pictures/34.PNG[/IMG]

*_ODBC_UID is always your DB Login Name
*_ODBC_PASSWD is always your DB Password
*_DB_SERVER_IP is always your DB IP
*_DB_SERVER_PORT is always your DB Port

(* is a placeholder, because we have several prefixes depending on the use, but all should be the same)

Now your server should be fine to start :w00t:

Now you just need a client for it, Search on google for: Ace Online EP 4.2 Client.
(Don't forget to put your checksummed files into the map folder)

[COLOR="#FF8C00"]I don't know if this is exactly working, because i didn't tied to run it. When problems appear, PM me or reply to the thread so i can fix them. Same with missing things.[/COLOR]
